Prin-Computer-Science-2.0
=========================

Document repository for developing a new set of activities, classes, simulations, and assignments that will help foster a stronger acumen for business and programming in the professional world.

Contributers will be alumni of the Computer Science program at Principia if they are interested in helping. Others may join and make pull requests, but these will be lower priority to alumni.

I'm going to leave the structure of this fairly undefined for now. It seems sensible to have a separate document for each idea/class and then all contributers can help iterate through developing each document.
